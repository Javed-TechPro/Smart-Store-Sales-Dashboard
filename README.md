# Smart Store Sales Dashboard in Power BI

This project demonstrates how to create a **Store Sales Dashboard** in Power BI with visual insights such as sales by category, subcategory, total profit, and best-performing regions or states.

## Project Overview
This dashboard provides:
- **Sales by Category**: Breakdown of sales performance for each product category.
- **Sales by Subcategory**: More detailed insights at the subcategory level.
- **Total Profit**: Visual representation of total profit by product and region.
- **Best Regions/States**: Highlighting top-performing regions based on sales and profit.

## Data Preparation
1. **Data Source**: 
   - The data is sourced from both `.csv` and `.xlsx` files, which are included in the repository.
   - Ensure you **transform the data** to clean and filter irrelevant information before use.
   
2. **Pre-Processing**:
   - Check the rows and columns of the dataset before starting the dashboard to ensure data consistency.
   - Columns include categories, subcategories, sales, profit, and regions/states.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Load the provided `.csv` or `.xlsx` files into Power BI.
- Visualize and modify the dashboard as needed to suit your store's sales insights.

## Visual Assets
I have included:
- **Images**: A preview of the dashboard and its components.
- **Video**: A short walkthrough of how the dashboard was built and key features highlighted.
